## Data Governance Council Composition

The Data Governance Council consists of the Data Governance Lead, Data Owners from the key departments of AIM, Finance, and HR (and other departments if designated by the Executive Sponsor), and the IT Representative. (Data Stewards may also attend as needed by their corresponding Data Owner, but are not voting members.) Members are appointed by the executive leadership and serve for a term of two years, with the possibility of renewal.
