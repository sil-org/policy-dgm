## Data Governance Council Meetings

The Data Governance Council meets quarterly to review data governance activities, address emerging issues, and make decisions on policies and standards. Additional ad-hoc meetings may be scheduled as needed, such as in response to significant data incidents or project milestones. Agendas are distributed at least one week in advance, and minutes are recorded and shared with all members and relevant stakeholders.
