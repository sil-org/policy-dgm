# Conflict Resolution for Definitional Issues

Definitional conflicts, such as disagreements on data terms, classifications, or standards, are resolved through a structured process:
When conflicts arise regarding data definitions, classifications, or standards, the following escalation process applies:

**Step 1: Working Group Resolution** The Data Governance Lead convenes a working group consisting of relevant stakeholders to discuss and attempt to resolve the conflict through collaborative dialogue. This group has 10 business days to reach consensus.

**Step 2: Council Mediation** If the working group cannot reach consensus, the issue is presented to the full Data Governance Council for discussion and voting. A simple majority vote resolves the conflict, with the Data Governance Lead facilitating neutral discussion.

**Step 3: Executive Decision** If the Council cannot reach consensus or if the conflict involves strategic implications, the Executive Director makes the final determination after considering all input and potential organizational impacts.
